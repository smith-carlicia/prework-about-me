      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>My name is Carlicia but people call me Carly for short. I'm 26 and have an amazing 5 year old daughter Madeline, whom I've named after the my favorite childhood cartoon. I love being creative, experimental and building things. Most importantly, I look forward to starting the bootcamp!</p>

      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>For almost about the past year, I've had a strong curiosity about mobile applications and software. From there, my curisity grew stronger and I discovered it's something I could possibly flex my creativity while simultaneously being on the technical end. Over the course of ongoing pandemic, I researched different roles and started doing some coding on different sites. Eventually, I realized I strongly gravitate towards web development.  </p>
